# book-f-ish

## Overview
Transform a fully functional Googlebooks app that is setup with a MERN stack using RESTful API and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with an Apollo Sever. Specifically, this project does the following from the Assignment criteria:
1) Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

2) Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

3) Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

4) Deploy the application to Heroku.

  ## Description
  * Advantages of the GraphQL API system are numerous, economical and efficient.
  * To streamline data management, it seems there will be much work ahead to transform RESTful APIs, in reality, merge the Apollo system with the RESTful API. 
  * This is generally a real-world scenario client request project.

  ## Installation
  * As a deployed application, there are no special instructions for use.  However, as a scop-of-work outline, there are several painstaking steps required in a particular sequence to make a smooth transition.
